1. create channel_function()
> it must indicate at what step, for each particular protocol, it was called
> it must indicate the node at which the function was sollicited
> it must check the availability of the channels and attribute one to the packet in question
> 


2. how does the attribution of the channel work
> it could be assigned to the packet while it is created
> it is better to attach a random channel at the start, and loop for the selection of a free channel during communication
> This could be with de channel_function(), the channel_function look if the variable channel is emty, and if it's emty channel_funtion add a random channelID to the new packet.

3. the  different protocols will act differently
> the token protocols must take into account that this functioning will occur for each and every token
> the buffer protocols will have to call the channel_function() once the packet is created, once there is transmission, once and if there is collision...
